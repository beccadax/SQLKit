/// Represents the results of a query.
/// 
/// A `SQLQuery` has two purposes. One is to access the instances representing 
/// each row (`SQLRow`) returned by the query. The other is to create the column 
/// keys (`SQLColumnKey`) used to access columns in those rows.
/// 
/// `SQLQuery` is only guaranteed to be a `Sequence`, so you may only be able to 
/// enumerate the rows returned by a query once. However, some clients return a 
/// `Collection`, `BidirectionalCollection`, or `RandomAccessCollection`; if they 
/// do, `SQLQuery` will support those additional protocols.
/// 
/// - Note: Due to language limitations, `Collection`s are handled by variant types, 
///          such as `SQLQueryCollection`. These present identical interfaces to 
///          `SQLQuery`, but add additional conformances.
// 
// WORKAROUND: #1 Swift doesn't support `where` clauses on associated types
